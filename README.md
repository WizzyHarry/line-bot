## Automated Response ChatBot

### The Purpose

<p> This chatbot is purely for entertainment purposes, it is not a product. The bot is designed to help assist new and current players
 in the mobile game knights and dragons. As a leader in my game community, I noticed that many new players had similar questions. 
 The bot contains answers for these questions, in response to a keyword led by an !. For example, if you had a question about the games
 chest system, you'd type !chests. A !help command is avaliable to display the list of commands. </p>

</n>

### Creation

<p> The bot is created entirely through Python, utilizing packages such as linebot, os, dotenv and flask in deployment/development processes. </n></p>

<p> Images and videos were uploaded to a free site, imgur, in order to be called by the bot. </p>

* Link to .py file: [python_bot](line_pybot.py)

### Deployment
